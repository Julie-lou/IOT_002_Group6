# 🌐 ESP32 → MQTT → Node-RED → InfluxDB → Grafana Dashboard

This project demonstrates a **complete IoT data pipeline** built with **ESP32 (MicroPython)**, **MQTT**, **Node-RED**, **InfluxDB**, and **Grafana**.  
It shows how real sensor data — including **temperature**, **pressure**, and **altitude** — flows seamlessly from hardware to a real-time dashboard.
